# AI_CNN_Dog_app

# Project Overview

The idea of the project is to create the feature of an app where you can upload a picture of a dog or a human face and the app would either
classify the dog breed or for a human face the dog breed this face has the highest similarty with. 

# Packages

For this jupyter notebook to run you need these common packages: Pyhton 3.6, jupyter notebook, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, sklearn,
keras, cv2.

# Files

dog_app.ipynb: a jupyter notebook explaning the whole algorithm to classify the images

other files : all the other files(around 3GB in size) are missing because of the file size limit at github. 


# Conclusion, Findings

The accuracy in my convolutional neural network reached 72 % in the classification of dog breeds by images.
